# Clinic_Queuing_Software_Clone

This is a repository made by me to present my simple clone of a clinic queuing software I made.

The project entails the following:
- allows new patients to get tokens
- allows the receptionist to see new patients and allot them the required doctor
- allows the receptionist to see the current status of the doctor (eg. free, live, or unavailable)
- allows the doctor to change his/her status
- allows the receptionist to call patients to the required room through the common_page webpage displayed in the waiting room TV
- allows you to save the details of patients who have already seen the doctor to history
